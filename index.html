                <h2>Biography of Fela Kuti</h2>
                <p>Fela Anikulapo Kuti (15 October 1938 â€“ 2 August 1997), also professionally known as Fela Kuti, or simply Fela,                
                was a Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, musician, composer, pioneer of the Afrobeat music genre and human rights activist.
                At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most "challenging and charismatic music performers".

                <p>
                Kuti was a political giant in Africa from the 1970s until his death. 
                He criticized the corruption of Nigerian government officials and the mistreatment of Nigerian citizens.
                He spoke of colonialism as the root of the socio-economic and political problems that plagued the African people. 
                Corruption was one of the worst political problems facing Africa in the 70s, if not the worst; and Nigeria was among the most corrupt countries of the time. Its government was responsible for election rigging and coups that ultimately worsened poverty, economic inequality, unemployment, and political instability, which further promoted corruption and thuggery.
                Fela's protest songs covered themes inspired by the realities of corruption and socio-economic inequality in Africa. Fela Kuti's political statements could be heard throughout Africa.

                Kuti is remembered as an influential icon who was brave enough to boldly voice his opinions on matters that affected the nation through his music. 
                An annual festival "Felabration" held each year to celebrate the life of this music legend and his birthday.
                Since his death in 1997, there has been a revival of his influence in music and popular culture, 
                culminating in another re-release of his catalog controlled by Universal Music, Broadway and off-Broadway biographically based shows, and new bands, such as Antibalas, who carry the Afrobeat banner to a new generation of listeners.
